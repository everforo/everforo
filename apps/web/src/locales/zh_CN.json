  "web3_title": "Web 3.0 - Community Platform",
  "web3_desc": "With the advancement of the Web 1.0 (Web Browser) and Web 2.0 (Self Publishing), online communities are available to everyone, and running an online community could also be a financially sustainable endeavour. However, over time, the choice of platforms became limited and centralized because big technology companies, such as Facebook or Reddit, did a great job in making online communities easy to use and very accessible.<br/><br/>Initially, online communities were owned and operated by enthusiasts (“forum owners”) who selected their choice of forum software, determined the layout and monetization strategy, or elected to have no monetization.   Nowadays, communities are often hosted on Facebook and Reddit. These centralized platforms have a great user interface and are easy to use for both the Admin and Users, but they also control and monetize your content and traffic, with no guarantees that your group will be online forever.  Just as <a href='https://support.google.com/plus/answer/9217723' target='_blank'>Google+</a> or <a href='https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2019/10/17/yahoo-groups-online-forum-shutdown/4007150002/' target='_blank'>Yahoo Groups</a> were shut down, other centralized platforms might one day shift their focus to something else, and decide to remove your content.<br/><br/>At Everforo, we are building a community platform that is not only easy to use, but also puts you in control of the content.  By carefully and gradually leveraging mature peer to peer, decentralization and blockchain technologies, your community content will be better connected, more open, and less centralized. That’s the spirit of <a href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/' target='_blank'>Web 3.0</a> and Everforo wants to contribute and be part of it in the Community space.",
  "home_tech_disclaimer": "Disclaimer: Blockchain technology is the building block for Bitcoin and other CryptoCurrencies.  CryptoCurrencies use blockchain technology because it is secure, information storage is decentralized, and information lasts forever.  The same benefits that blockchain provides the safety in issuing and storing BitCoin is leveraged to make a secure, decentralized, ever-lasting forum.  And while Everforo uses the blockchain technology, it does not have any connection to Bitcoin or any other CryptoCurrency.",
  "home_tech_ipfs_title": "Introducing IPFS to Online Communities",
  "home_tech_ipfs_desc": "Everforo synchronizes your community data with <a href='https://ipfs.io/' target='_blank'>IPFS</a>. IPFS is a peer to peer decentralized storage system that allows us to store your content not only on our servers,  but also being mirrored to external data storage providers via IPFS. Everforo also runs a IPFS node that stores just Everforo content, and pings other public IPFS servers to request them to store your content on their server. Everforo defines a JSON format of your community topics, posts and attachments and stores them in IPFS. Each group is assigned an unique URL that only the owner has access to, and the URL points to the group's entire community content in JSON.   This ensures that the content is always accessible, and also provides the ability to migrate the community to anywhere else.",

We believe an interface must be easy to use and easy to administrate. The Web and App interface provided by Everforo is currently a proprietary software that is only available under everforo.com. Think about Everforo's website and mobile app is like Gmail - You can use Gmail for free, but your emails are stored and accessible with the standard POP3/IMAP protocol. Except that with IPFS we go one step further, the content is stored in the decentralized manner so you can retrieve them at any time.",

  "faq": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "home_tech_q1": "Q: I am not very interested in blockchain or decentralization, or whether it is actually owned by me. But I like the Everforo interface. Can I just use it like a typical community platform?",
  "home_tech_a1": "Yes! Everforo’s mission is to make the new technology friendly and easy to use. You and your members can use it just like Facebook Groups without needing to understand the underlying technology, with the additional peace of mind that you will own the group content forever.",
  "home_tech_q2": "Q: I just created a new Everforo group. How do my members login to my group? What kind of user info can I collect?",
  "home_tech_a2": "Your members can either sign up and join with email, or if they don’t want to disclose their email address, they can use their mobile device to login anonymously.",
  "home_tech_q3": "Q: Can I get email addresses of my members?",
  "home_tech_a3": "No, users have the choice to join your group with or without disclosing their email address to Everforo.com. If users login with their email address, the email address is kept in our Everforo database and is not disclosed to the group owner.",
  "home_tech_q4": "Q: How do I engage with my members if I do not have their email addresses?",
  "home_tech_a4": "We plan to develop features where your members can opt-in to be notified either by email or by the mobile app push notifications when you post an important topic to the community.",
  "home_tech_q5": "Q: I control members that join my group, and potentially ban members that are creating havoc in my community. Can that be done on Everforo?",
  "home_tech_a5": "Initially, all groups in Everforo are public groups and everyone can join. As the group admins you will be able to remove anyone from your group so they will no longer be able to participate and be prevented from joining the group again. Your members can also “block” any members so they will no longer see posts and updates from people they don’t like to see.",
  "home_tech_q6": "Q: How do I screen my users if I don’t know anything about the user before joining the group. ",
  "home_tech_a6": "Currently Everforo does not provide you a way to “approve” membership. However it is one of our top priorities to allow you to ask a few questions and to manually approve them.",
  "home_tech_q7": "Q: I use email and IP address to control SPAM.  If I do not have access to that information, how do I control SPAM?",
  "home_tech_a7": "Spam and abuse are centrally controlled by Everforo team for any content hosted in everforo.com. We have a strong incentive to keep the Everforo.com domain in good reputation and conform with local laws and regulations. If you are concerned about Everforo.com using this as a way to censor your content, you will be interested in our long term road map of how we will empower you to set up your own custom domain and run your own IPFS node so you have more resistance in censorship and control.",
  "home_tech_q8": "Q: How can I be sure I actually own the group? Since my group depends on your website and mobile app to work?",
  "home_tech_a8": "All Everforo groups can only be accessed on Everforo.com. Our first goal is to help you to maintain an immutable content synchronization service with IPFS. As the owner of the group, you will be provided with a IPFS URL that syncs with your community content. Everforo will also publish the file format specifications so you or your developer can download, parse and import your content to other community software should you decide to move to another platform.<br/><br/>As the project progresses and related technology matures, we will increase “decentralization.” For example, a member could continue to use Everforo mobile app to login to your group regardless of the underlying platform you are using.  In this case,  after you migrate to your own self-hosted forum software, your forum could continue to use Everforo’s Single Sign On service so your members can be migrated over to your own database.",
  "home_tech_q9": "Q: What are other examples of “decentralization” that Everforo can achieve?",
  "home_tech_a9": "Everforo hopes to empower you to create a community where it can be co-owned by multiple people, with ability to vote on important matters such as promoting or demoting moderators and admins, sharing revenue, and ability to conduct crowdfunding with your members. We understand the additional features raise lots of questions on how they will actually work, and we will share more details as we progress.",
  "home_tech_q10": "Q: Does Everforo run on IPFS?",
  "home_tech_a10": "Currently Everforo hosts all attachments and inline images in IPFS where your web browser directly fetches the content from our IPFS proxy, and post content (text content) is stored in our database but also periodically synchronized with IPFS. We will gradually move more static resources to IPFS when we see fit and when the speed is satisfactory.",
  "home_tech_q11": "Q: Who will actually pay the bill? Isn’t content storage costs increasing as the amount of content continues to grow (and is never deleted)?",
  "home_tech_a11": "To understand the cost of hosting your content, you need to understand how IPFS works and how Everforo synchronizes with IPFS. Everforo runs its own IPFS node where all inline images and attachments are stored. The post content, in addition to saving in IPFS, is also saved in Everforo’s database (for better search and content indexing, etc).<br/><br/>We also request third party IPFS nodes synchronize multiple copies of the same content on multiple servers. You can actually see a list of nodes when you mouse over the tiny IPFS icon next to the timestamp of each post. However, without paying other nodes, your content in their servers may or may not last forever as they can periodically delete content that is unpaid. It is similar to a cached file that will eventually expire and will be deleted.<br/><br/>To make sure you have ever-lasting backup beyond Everforo controlled servers, over time you’ll be able to pay a small monthly fee to Everforo to increase the synchronization frequencies, and that fee will also let us to pay to <a href='https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/persistence/' target='_blank'>pin</a> your files on other nodes so they would not be deleted, and remain readily available.<br/><br/>Eventually, you will also be able to run your own IPFS node for your content and will be able to directly synchronize your content to your node.  Everforo will eventually publish technical specs for IPFS to enable you to manage your own node.",
  "home_tech_q12": "Q: How do I delete my group? And  how do I make sure I can delete content that I do not want?",
  "home_tech_a12": "When you delete a group or your own post, your content will be deleted from our centralized database just like a typical web application. This action alone can prevent members from accessing the content from your group interface.<br/><br/>However, because the way IPFS is designed, content that has already synchronized in other nodes can not be deleted immediately and might take a long time to be removed even after we stop pinning (and paying) them. <br/><br/>Although the content is still out there, it doesn’t mean the content is easily accessible. For example, imagine a file is stored on a random server, but it is not connected to any web server. The file still exists, but is essentially inaccessible. Any web server that serves files from IPFS content are essentially private servers and they have the responsibility to blacklist any content according to local law and regulations.",
  "home_tech_q13": "Q: If, as an end-user, I delete my data, does the forum owner still have a copy?",
  "home_tech_a13": "When a post is deleted by you or by the admins, a post placeholder is inserted: “The post is deleted by someone.” Both admins and the post author can undo the deletion within seven days. After seven days, no one, including the Admin or Post author can undelete the post. However, the deleted content is still stored in the IPFS, and both admins and the post author can still access the raw format of the deleted content in IPFS via the IPFS icon at the upper right corner of the post.",
  "home_tech_q14": "Q: If Everforo shuts down tomorrow, how do I go to make sure my group can continue to run?",
  "home_tech_a14": "Assuming you have saved your group IPFS hash address, you will be able to download the backup from any IPFS nodes. Write a simple script to parse the JSON file, you can then re-import your group into other community platforms like phpBB, Xenforo, or Discourse.<br/><br/>Everforo’s vision of community decentralization is not just content storage synchronization. Gradually, Everforo will build more components that can be native on blockchain, whenever it makes sense for the users, and whenever the technology and our resources make it feasible to do.",
  "home_tech_q15": "Q: How do I transfer my group ownership to someone else?",
  "home_tech_a15": "Currently, you will have to contact Everforo support team to perform this manually. However, Everforo will soon roll out a simple transfer interface where you can enter a target username that you want to take ownership of the forum. As mentioned previously, in the future, if a group is co-owned by multiple people, group ownership becomes a matter of voting and percentage of ownership amongst the owners.",
  "home_tech_q16": "Q: Can I make money from the generated traffic just like a traditional web property, such as advertisement?",
  "home_tech_a16": "Everforo does not monetize from advertising and we hope we will never have to add advertising.  In the coming months, we will roll out various features and tools that admins can use to generate revenue and engage audiences.  We will soon allow your members to donate to your group with PayPal, Credit Cards, and eventually Bitcoin.  We also plan on empowering members to financially reward each other, and provide you with a tool to define reward rules to which your members rewards could be in the form of cash (paid through PayPal or Stripe), Bitcoin or any ERC20 compatibility tokens.",
  "home_tech_q17": "Q: Can I have my own domain for my group instead of under Everforo.com?",
  "home_tech_a17": "This is a future feature that we will  support. We also plan to support .eth domains as part of our decentralization initiative where you can easily sign up .eth domain with our interface and the ability to rebrand your Everforo group entirely with your own brand and with your own domain.",
  "home_tech_q18": "Q: Is there a limit on how much data can be stored per user?",
  "home_tech_a18": "There is currently no limit at the user level; however, there will be a limit at the group level. While we plan to charge a small fee for additional space, the fee will be very reasonable. Also, as we plan to support direct read and write to external IPFS nodes, you will be able to host your own storage server where you have direct control over the data size as well as the bandwidth.",
  "home_tech_q19": "Q: I currently self-host my group. Can I move it to everforo?",
  "home_tech_a19": "Yes. Please <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmg9m9AHxokpMMix6nK-8Gvkv9bvXXPhAzV-7fbMsNnZWV3Q/viewform' target='_blank'>submit a migration request</a> if you would like to discuss the migration options with our team.",
  "home_tech_q20": "Q: Is everforo for all ages? Am I allowed to upload / post adult content?",
  "home_tech_a20": "Because all the groups can only be accessed via Everforo.com. We will need to implement some level of content control to conform with local laws and regulations. And because any Everforo group “user generated content” site, our mobile app is classified as “Mature 17+” in the United States. Everforo adds a layer of protection to warn users certain images may be explicit and require users to manually click the post again to view the full content.  However, neither Apple and nor Google allows content that is “offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy.” (App Store Content Guidelines.)  All hosting providers have similar guidelines, and any content that is violation of the guideline may need to be removed from view in the app and/or website.<br/><br/>In the future, as we roll out support for custom domain service, together with an external IPFS node, you’ll be able to run your own group without being tied to Everforo.com content regulation.  But be aware that any hosting environment will have similar guidelines, so Child Porn, Sex Traffickers, White Supremeists, and other plain creepy sites should not look to Everforo as a safe haven.",
  "home_tech_q21": "Q: Is there a limit on how many groups I can create at everforo?",
  "home_tech_a21": "No limit at the moment, until someone abuses it...",
  "home_tech_q22": "Q: Can groups be made private at Everforo?",
  "home_tech_a22": "Initially all groups will be public where everyone can join while admins can always ban certain users from posting. You can also opt-out from the “Discovery” feature so that only people with your URL can find your group.<br/><br/>Gradually we will add more privacy feature but keep in mind that all content are stored in IPFS so technically anyone with enough technical knowledge and with the IPFS hash they can always access it beyond we can control, although we believe in most cases, Everforo can be made private enough for most groups as long as you are not storing sensitive information such as your personal information or passwords in the group.",
  "home_tech_q23": "Q: How do I invite people to join my group?",
  "home_tech_a23": "Yes! Although we don’t provide tools that let you import contacts and send out emails for you, you can always simply share the URL of your group to anyone to join.",
  "home_tech_q24": "Q: What happens if a member posts a DMCA violation, won’t it be hard to delete?",
  "home_tech_a24": "You can easily remove the content from your group. And since the content is hosted in Everforo.com, in most cases we’ll also get notified and will remove it on behalf of you as well. However, since the content is also synchronized with IPFS, the same content might be available via other private IPFS gateways, the copyright owner would have to contact each gateway to remove the content and prevent from serving it from their private gateways.",
  "home_tech_q25": "Q: If I don’t have a phone, can I still post anonymously?",
  "home_tech_a25": "You will require to have a verified email address to post without using Everforo mobile app.",
  "home_tech_q26": "Q: How do I know Everforo is right for me?",
  "home_tech_a26": "<p>You know Everforo is right for you if you:</p><ul style='padding-left:4rem;list-style:disc';><li>Want a reliable way to store your community data that is ever-lasting and has some control of where your data can be stored.</li><li>Want a simple, ease of use interface just like Facebook Groups but don’t want your group to be actually in Facebook.</li><li>Has control over where your data is stored as your community grows</li><li>Are conscious about user privacy, GDPR etc and want to minimize user information being exposed to the provider or even yourself</li><li>Do not want to run your own server and would rather pay for open, third party services while still retaining some control.</li><li>Want a platform that is developed toward Web 3.0 to be more decentralized over time.</li><li>Care about product road map and general product direction, with awesome support from the developer.</li></ul>",
