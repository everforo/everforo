Although we will use good faith efforts to respond to your request, we may not be able to provide and/or delete your personal information in all situations.  For example, we may not be able to provide the personal information requested if it imposes an undue burden or expense, requires us to release confidential commercial information, requires the disclosure of personal information relating to another person, or requires authentication of the request that is not feasible.

As set forth above, the information that we collect about you when you use the Service may include certain digital identifiers that are considered “personal data” under European law.  We process this data either as it is necessary to further our legitimate interest and/or pursuant to your consent.

            <p>
                Finally, as a resident of the EEA, you have the right to lodge a complaint about our processing of personal data with a European Data Protection Authority.
