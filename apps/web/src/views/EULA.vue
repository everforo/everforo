/**
// # Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags. 
For example, <b>bold</b> indicates that visual output devices should render "bold" in bold text, 
<i>italic</i> render "italic" in italic text.

// # You need to print all the phrases that are enclosed inside the <i> tag. 
The function re.findall is very useful in this task. Learn the syntax of this function yourself.

// # Input format: Input data is a text divided into lines. 
The input ends with an empty line. You don't need to join lines together, process them separately.

// # Output format: Print the phrases enclosed in the <i> tag in the same order as they were in the text.
